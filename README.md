## About ##

I (man0fbass) made this during my spare time at school. Keep in mind that there will probably be some bugs and the code *definitely* needs to be cleaned up a lot. Feel free to help me improve upon it!

This is a damage calculator for the MMORPG game Wizard101, created by Kingsisle Entertainment. You can check out the game [here.](https://www.wizard101.com/game)

There are many like it, but they're all horribly outdated! Also, none of them are open source!

This damage calculator was designed to be:

 - lightweight and easy to use
 - compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux
 - adaptive to ALL combat situations
 - applied in PvP!

## Features ##

 - Calculates damage just like the game
 - Speedy and flexible data entry for traps and blades
