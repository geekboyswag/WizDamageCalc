## About ##

This is a damage calculator for the MMORPG game Wizard101, created by Kingsisle Entertainment. You can check out the game [here.](https://www.wizard101.com/game)

There are many like it, but they're all horribly outdated! Also, none of them are open source!

This damage calculator was designed to be:

 - lightweight and easy to use
 - compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux
 - adaptive to ALL combat situations
 - easily applied in PvP

## Features ##

 - Calculates your damage accurately
 - Speedy and flexible data entry for traps and blades
 - Supports mechanics such as pierce and shadow magic
 - Tells you if your hit will kill (and if not, how much health is left)
 - Not capped at a million! (I'm looking at you KI >____>)

## FAQ ##

I'm working on a video that puts damage calculation in layman's terms. Stay tuned!

Having no images keeps the file size low.
